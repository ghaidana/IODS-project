Hello! My name is Ghaida, you can also call me Gege. I am a first year master's student at University of Helsinki's Contemporary Societies program. \
I am feeling quite well today. I hope I will be able to use R more comfortably after this course!\
I actually took this course last year from the MOOC, but I did not get to do the peer review part because I did it outside of the planned schedule... \
I first found this course last year when I was hunting for a master's program. I decided to take the course to get 'a try' on a learning experience at the University of Helsinki.\
As I have taken the Quantitative Research Skill course last period, I have already done skimming the R for Health Data Science book, but it was nice to do a quick review. It was a lot of materials for sure! My favorite part is creating plots!\
